GlobalTechAnalytics is a package designed to analyze Resource data and provide insights into Resource Attrition and Project delivery. It includes a Shiny application for interactive data exploration.


### 1. Install the necessary tools (if not already installed)

If you donâ€™t have the `pak` or `devtools` packages installed, you can install them first. `pak` is the recommended tool for installing dependencies from GitHub.

```r
# Install 'pak' (if not already installed)
install.packages("pak")

# Or install 'devtools' (alternative method)
install.packages("devtools")
```

### 2. Install **GlobalTechAnalytics** from GitHub

Once `pak` or `devtools` is installed, you can install **GlobalTechAnalytics** from GitHub:

```r
# Using pak (recommended)
pak::pak("Anna-KG/GlobalTechAnalytics")

# Or using devtools
devtools::install_github("Anna-KG/GlobalTechAnalytics")
```

This will install **GlobalTechAnalytics** along with all its dependencies, including **shiny**.

### 3. Install Shiny (if not already installed)

If **shiny** is not already installed on your system, install it by running:

```r
install.packages("shiny")
```

## Example

After installation, you can load the package and run the Shiny app. Here's a simple example of how to get started:

```r
# Load the package
library(GlobalTechAnalytics)

# Run the Shiny app
shiny::runApp(system.file("shiny", package = "GlobalTechAnalytics"))
```

### What Happens Next?
- This will launch the Shiny app in your default web browser.
- The app will be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:xxxx` in your browser, where `xxxx` is a dynamic port number assigned to the app.

## Usage

Once the app is running, you can interact with it directly through the browser.
